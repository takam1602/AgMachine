	• 	Standard features: sequential shift, shuttle shift, auto-shift, programmable downshift/upshift, speed matching
	• 	Speed range from 0 to 19.5 mph
	• 	Abundant gear meshes provide smooth power flow and performance
	• 	Oil-cooled disk-type brakes located inside final drives
	• 	Optional creeper gears allow for ultra slow-speed applications


Final Drives
	• 	Inboard planetary gears assure close monitoring of lubrication temperatures
	• 	Critical fluids (hydraulics, transmission oil and planetary gear oil) are constantly circulated through oil cooler for longer life


Patented Cat Differential Steering
	  	

 
Tractor
	• 	Pioneered and patented by Caterpillar
	• 	Hydraulic/mechanical design delivers smooth, reliable steering
	• 	Stronger and more durable than conventional electronic systems

	• 	Turning under load exceeds wheel tractor ability, particularly at 120-inch setting
	• 	Cat drive reduction system provides smooth, quiet operation
	• 	Requires less operator effort to steer, improving comfort and decreasing fatigue


Responsive Hydraulics
	• 	Hydraulic capacity is 43 gpm at 2900 psi for plenty of reserve power
	• 	High-performance system features ample hydraulic flow (31.2 gpm flow) at couplers
	• 	Hydraulic flow levers give comforting feeling of control
	• 	In-cab flow controls allow convenient fine-tuning


Cab
	  	Cab
	• 	Excellent visibility all-around
	• 	Eight-way adjustable air-ride suspension seat for comfort
	• 	Iso-mounts absorb shock loads, smoothing ride for the operator and adding tractor life

	• 	Patented rubber material in cab iso-mounts reduces shock loads and noise levels
	• 	Movable control console allows adjustment for individual comfort
	• 	Monitor control center located in front console within easy sight of the operator


Tractor Balance
	• 	Track tractors have different center of gravity than wheel tractors
	• 	Caterpillar knows this and allows for selective weight addition:
		
	- 	Front suitcase - counterbalance drawbar loads
	- 	Front idler - additional front counterbalance to offset 3-pt. hitch weight and drawbar loads


MODEL 	PTO power 	Drawbar power (firm ground)
Challenger 35 	175 hp (131 kW) 	150 hp (112 kW)
Challenger 45 	200 hp (149 kW) 	170 hp (127 kW)
Challenger 55 	225 hp (168 kW) 	191 hp (142 kW)
